# Introduction

EduVR allows everyone to create unlimited 3D classroom by minting a passport on-chain. We leverage WebRTC technology to provide free, anonymized, and decentralized meetings. Which allow students to fully immerse into the classroom, this provides an interactive experience.

# Problem Statement
 
We understand that existing meeting software for holding virtual classes are expensive and often comes with different limitations in the call duration and number of participants, our decision to create a 3D classroom was based on new emerging technologies being developed like the Meta Quest and Apple vision Pro, immersing yourself In a 3D on-chain classroom, that also offers privacy A lot of classroom software have shady privacy policies which include recording meetings with the intent of using it to training or test AI.

# Solution

Our solution is a free, private, decentralized and open 3D on-chain application that provides an immersive experience, which allow us to incorporate 3D models and element to offer more interactive way for the teacher and student to engage. Users can fully immerse themselves, and pick their character of their choice. We use peer-to-peer technology like WebRTC to provide unlimited meetings.

# Current Functionalities

We have successfully implemented several features in our 3D classroom using the Open Campus Network, Solidity, React Three Fiber, WebRTC, and WalletConnect These features will allow users to:

- Minting Passport
- Creating Classroom
- Screen sharing and real-time streaming
- Real-time participant tracking

# Roadmap

- **Phase 1: Prototype**
- Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product
- Phase 3: Beta Launch
- Phase 3: Launch

# Challenges and Lesson During the Hackathon

During the hackathon, we faced several challenges, which we successfully tackled and learned from. Our first challenge was integrating WebRTC, we first detected it wasnâ€™t working on different network due to VPN extension in the browser.

# Conclusion

The development 3D classroom is a significant step forward in creating, interactive user experiences. We used peer-to-peer technologies to differentiate ourselves in the  market, provide users with a unique way to connect, interact, and learn from any anywhere. This is the Future of Education on-chain!
